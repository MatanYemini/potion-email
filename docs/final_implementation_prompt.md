Okay, let's detail the technical build steps for the first two phases (MVP and Initial Validation/GTM) of the **Context-Aware Social Engineering Defense** platform, focusing heavily on incorporating LLMs effectively.

**Guiding Principles:**

- **LLMs for Nuance:** Leverage LLMs primarily for understanding the _semantic meaning, intent, context, and subtlety_ of language that rule-based systems miss.
- **Combine Signals:** LLMs are powerful but not perfect. Combine LLM insights with other signals (sender reputation, behavioral anomalies via graph, threat intel) for robust detection.
- **Focus on Explainability:** Use LLMs not just to detect, but also to _explain_ the risk in simple terms for users and admins.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Treat the AI/LLM component as a core product feature that requires continuous training, evaluation, and refinement based on real-world feedback.
- **Security First:** Handle sensitive communication data with extreme care throughout the process.

**Phase 0: MVP Development (Approx. Months 1-6/9) - Technical Build Steps**

**Goal:** Working MVP for M365 Email BEC detection using LLM context analysis, delivering user warnings.

1.  **Setup Secure Development Environment:**

    - **How To:** Establish cloud accounts (AWS/GCP/Azure). Set up source control (Git). Implement basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated testing and linting. Set up Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi).
    - **Tech Stack:** AWS/GCP/Azure, Git, Terraform, Docker, Python.

2.  **Develop Secure M365 Data Ingestion Service:**

    - **How To:** Create a backend service (e.g., using Python/FastAPI). Implement Microsoft Graph API integration using OAuth 2.0 (securely handle tokens). Focus on fetching necessary email components: headers (From, To, CC, Reply-To, Return-Path, Authentication-Results - DKIM/SPF/DMARC), subject, body (plain text and HTML), and sender/recipient metadata. Initially, process emails via subscription/webhook (near real-time) or periodic polling (batch). Ensure data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest.
    - **Tech Stack:** Python (FastAPI/Django), Microsoft Graph SDK, OAuth 2.0 library, PostgreSQL/managed DB (for temporary processing storage/metadata), Redis (for task queuing).

3.  **Core LLM Selection, Fine-tuning, and Deployment:**

    - **How To:**
      - **Selection:** Choose a base LLM. Options:
        - _Self-hosted Open Source:_ Models like DistilBERT, RoBERTa, or larger models (e.g., Llama variants, Mistral) if compute allows. Requires more MLOps effort. (Good for data control).
        - _Managed Endpoint:_ AWS SageMaker/GCP Vertex AI hosting for open-source models. Balances control and ease.
        - _API-based (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic):_ Easiest to start, potentially most powerful models, BUT requires strict data privacy agreements and handling (ensure data isn't used for their training, consider latency/cost).
      - **Fine-tuning Data:** Curate a dataset combining:
        - Public phishing/BEC datasets (e.g., Nazario, Fraud GMAIL Corpus - anonymized).
        - General corporate communication datasets (e.g., Enron - for baseline tone/style).
        - _Crucially:_ Plan for securely incorporating _anonymized_ data from design partners later. Use techniques like PII masking/replacement during pre-processing.
        - _(LLM Enhancement)_ Consider using a powerful base LLM (like GPT-4/Claude via API) to _generate synthetic examples_ of sophisticated BEC attacks based on descriptions/patterns, augmenting the fine-tuning dataset (requires careful validation).
      - **Fine-tuning Task:** Train the LLM on tasks like:
        - **Intent Classification:** Is this asking for payment, credentials, urgency, gift cards, change of contact info?
        - **Sentiment/Urgency Analysis:** Is the tone unusual, manipulative, overly urgent?
        - **Entity Recognition:** Extracting amounts, bank details, names, roles for analysis.
        - **Impersonation Signals:** Detecting subtle cues in language or signature deviations (beyond simple name checks).
      - **Deployment:** Deploy the fine-tuned LLM as a secure microservice endpoint (e.g., using SageMaker Endpoints, Vertex AI Endpoints, or self-hosted with appropriate scaling/security).
    - **Tech Stack:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow, MLflow (for tracking experiments), selected LLM hosting solution (SageMaker/Vertex AI/API provider/Self-hosted KServe/BentoML), Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate - optional for advanced semantic search later).

4.  **Develop Risk Scoring Engine:**

    - **How To:** Create a service that takes features from multiple sources and calculates a risk score.
      - **LLM Features:** Intent probabilities, sentiment scores, detected entities, impersonation flags generated by the LLM service.
      - **Heuristic Features:** Basic checks like known bad domain/IP (integrate basic threat feed), SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, display name vs. actual sender mismatch.
      - **Model:** Start with a simple weighted scoring system or a basic ML classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) trained on these combined features.
    - **Tech Stack:** Python (scikit-learn), Backend framework (FastAPI/Django).

5.  **Implement MVP Warning Mechanism:**

    - **How To:** Create a service that, upon receiving a high-risk score:
      - _(LLM Enhancement)_ Calls the LLM (or a separate, potentially smaller/faster LLM fine-tuned for summarization) to generate a _concise, human-readable explanation_ of the _primary_ detected risk(s) (e.g., "Unusual payment request detected," "Sender name may be impersonating [Real Name]").
      - Injects this explanation into the email body (e.g., prepend `"[AI SECURITY WARNING]: Unusual payment request detected. Verify externally before acting."`) or attempts integration via M365 Add-ins (more complex but better UX). Ensure clear branding/demarcation.
    - **Tech Stack:** Backend framework, M365 APIs (potentially EWS or Add-in framework).

6.  **Basic Logging & Monitoring:**
    - **How To:** Implement structured logging for all services. Set up basic monitoring for service uptime and error rates. Log risk scores and decisions (without storing full PII email bodies long-term unless securely archived and necessary).
    - **Tech Stack:** Elasticsearch/OpenSearch + Kibana (logging), Prometheus + Grafana (metrics), CloudWatch/Google Cloud Monitoring.

---

**Phase 1: Initial Validation & GTM (Approx. Months 6/9 - 18/24) - Technical Build Steps**

**Goal:** Improve accuracy, implement relationship graph, build admin dashboard, onboard paying customers.

7.  **Iterate on LLM & Risk Model (Accuracy Focus):**

    - **How To:**
      - **Feedback Loop:** Collect feedback from design partners/early customers (via dashboard or simple reporting) on flagged emails (accurate, false positive, missed).
      - **Data Enrichment:** Securely ingest anonymized, labeled data from customers (with explicit permission and strong anonymization/PII scrubbing) into the training dataset.
      - **Retraining Pipeline:** Build a semi-automated pipeline to regularly retrain/fine-tune the LLM and the risk scoring model with new data and feedback. Evaluate rigorously against benchmark datasets and shadow deployments. Focus heavily on reducing False Positives.
      - _(LLM Enhancement)_ Explore more advanced LLM techniques like using embeddings for semantic similarity checks (is this request similar to known BEC patterns?), or few-shot prompting for handling new attack variations identified from feedback. Consider RLHF principles if feasible.
    - **Tech Stack:** MLOps tools (MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker Pipelines), data annotation tools (internal or e.g., Label Studio), refined evaluation frameworks.

8.  **Implement Relationship Graph Service:**

    - **How To:**
      - **DB Setup:** Deploy and configure a Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, AWS Neptune).
      - **Schema Design:** Define nodes (e.g., `InternalUser`, `ExternalContact`, `Domain`) and edges representing communication (`SENT_EMAIL`, `REPLIED_TO`, `CC_ON`) with properties like `timestamp`, `count`, potentially `topic_cluster` (see below).
      - **Data Pipeline:** Create a secure pipeline (e.g., using Kafka/Kinesis or batch jobs) to extract _metadata_ (From, To, Cc, Timestamp, ThreadID) from the ingestion service and load it into the graph DB. _Avoid storing message bodies in the graph_.
      - **Graph Feature Extraction:** Develop services that run graph queries (e.g., using Cypher for Neo4j) on demand or periodically to generate features like:
        - `is_first_time_communication`
        - `communication_frequency_anomaly` (compared to baseline for this pair)
        - `is_unusual_recipient_for_sender` (e.g., CEO directly emailing AP clerk)
        - _(LLM Enhancement)_ Periodically run an offline batch process using an LLM (fine-tuned for topic modeling) on anonymized email bodies/subjects to _infer communication topics_. Add these topics as properties to graph edges (e.g., `topic: 'invoice_payment'`). This allows detecting unusual topic shifts (e.g., someone who only discusses marketing suddenly asking for finance action).
      - **Integration:** Feed these graph-derived features into the main Risk Scoring Engine (Step 4) alongside LLM features.
    - **Tech Stack:** Neo4j/Neptune/ArangoDB, Graph query language (Cypher, Gremlin), Kafka/Kinesis/RabbitMQ (for data pipeline), Python drivers for graph DB.

9.  **Develop Admin Dashboard:**

    - **How To:** Build a web application for security admins. Features:
      - View flagged emails/messages.
      - See detailed risk score breakdown (LLM confidence, heuristic flags, graph anomaly signals).
      - _(LLM Enhancement)_ Display the LLM-generated _explanation_ for why an item was flagged.
      - Mechanism for admins to mark items as False Positive/True Positive (feedback loop for Step 7).
      - Basic user management and policy settings (e.g., risk thresholds).
      - Basic reporting on detected threat types/trends.
      - Secure authentication/authorization for admins.
    - **Tech Stack:** Frontend Framework (React/Vue/Angular), Backend API (Python - FastAPI/Django), UI Component Library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design), Charting Library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js).

10. **Develop Google Workspace (Gmail) Integration:**

    - **How To:** Replicate the data ingestion service (Step 2) using the Gmail API. Adapt authentication (OAuth 2.0 for Google). Ensure the core LLM and risk scoring engine can handle potential minor differences in data format or metadata. Adapt warning mechanism if needed (Gmail Add-ons or body prepend).
    - **Tech Stack:** Google API Client Library for Python, Gmail API.

11. **Enhance Scalability, Monitoring, and Security:**
    - **How To:** Refactor services for better scalability (e.g., stateless services, efficient database usage). Implement more comprehensive monitoring (application performance monitoring - APM, distributed tracing). Conduct initial security audits/penetration tests. Formalize incident response plan.
    - **Tech Stack:** Kubernetes (auto-scaling), APM tools (Datadog, New Relic), Security scanning tools (SAST/DAST like Snyk, Checkmarx - integrated into CI/CD), potentially WAF (Web Application Firewall).

By following these steps, focusing on the LLM's strengths in understanding context and combining it with other signals like the relationship graph, you can build a robust and differentiated social engineering defense platform. Remember to prioritize security, privacy, and iterative improvement based on real-world data.

Okay, let's deep-dive into the technical specifics for building the **MVP** of the Context-Aware Social Engineering Defense tool, focusing on **Google Workspace (Gmail)** integration and leveraging **Google Gemini** alongside traditional checks.

**Core Architecture Goal:** A system that intercepts/analyzes incoming Gmail messages, uses both traditional signals and Gemini's contextual understanding to assign a risk score, and flags potentially dangerous emails directly within the user's Gmail interface.

**Technical Build Steps (Detailed):**

**1. Secure Setup & Google Cloud Foundation:**

- **How To:**
  - Create a dedicated Google Cloud Project.
  - Enable necessary APIs: Gmail API, Google Cloud Pub/Sub API, Cloud Functions API, Cloud Run API, Secret Manager API, Cloud SQL Admin API, Google AI Generative Language API (for Gemini).
  - Set up IAM roles and permissions with the principle of least privilege.
  - Configure VPC network, firewall rules if necessary.
  - Use Google Cloud Secret Manager to securely store API keys (Gmail API credentials, Gemini API key, Threat Intel API keys) and other sensitive configuration.
- **Tech Stack:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IAM, VPC, Secret Manager, Terraform/Cloud Deployment Manager (for IaC).

**2. Gmail Integration & Email Ingestion:**

- **How To:**
  - **Authentication:** Create a Service Account in GCP. Grant it domain-wide delegation authority in your Google Workspace Admin console for the required Gmail API scopes (likely `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` to read and potentially modify/label emails, or `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` if only reading initially). Securely store the Service Account key JSON in Secret Manager.
  - **Notification Setup:** Use the Gmail API's `users.watch()` method for each monitored mailbox. Configure it to send push notifications to a specific Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic whenever a new email arrives (`labelIds=['INBOX']`, `labelFilterAction='include'`). This is more efficient than polling.
  - **Triggering Processing:** Create a Google Cloud Function (or Cloud Run service) triggered by messages published to the designated Pub/Sub topic. This function will be the starting point for processing each new email. It receives the user's email address and history ID.
- **Tech Stack:** Google Workspace Admin SDK, Gmail API, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Functions (Python runtime recommended), Google Identity Platform (for Service Accounts), Python `google-api-python-client` library.

**3. Email Fetching and Preprocessing Service:**

- **How To:**
  - The triggered Cloud Function/Service uses the received user email and history ID, authenticates using the Service Account (impersonating the user via domain-wide delegation), and calls the Gmail API (`users.messages.get`) to fetch the full email content (format=`FULL`).
  - Parse the email payload:
    - Extract key headers: `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Subject`, `Reply-To`, `Return-Path`, `Message-ID`, `Authentication-Results` (for DKIM/SPF/DMARC).
    - Extract the email body. Prioritize the plain text version (`text/plain`). If only HTML is available (`text/html`), use a library to parse and extract clean text content, stripping potentially malicious scripts or styles.
    - Store essential parsed metadata and the cleaned text body for downstream processing. Avoid storing raw email bodies longer than necessary for processing.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, `google-api-python-client`, `beautifulsoup4` (for HTML parsing), `email` (standard Python library for header parsing), Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) or Firestore (for temporary storage/job tracking).

**4. Traditional Security Checks Module:**

- **How To:**
  - Create a microservice or library responsible for traditional checks:
    - **SPF/DKIM/DMARC:** Parse the `Authentication-Results` header. Implement logic to determine pass/fail/neutral status for each protocol based on domain policies.
    - **Sender Domain Reputation:** Extract the sender domain (from `From` header). Query external Threat Intelligence APIs (e.g., Google Safe Browsing API, VirusTotal API, commercial feeds) or internal lists for known malicious/suspicious domains.
    - **IP Reputation (Optional but Recommended):** Extract the originating IP address from the `Received` headers (requires careful parsing). Query Threat Intelligence APIs for IP reputation (spam source, malware C2, etc.).
    - **Basic Keyword/Pattern Matching:** Include simple checks for high-risk keywords related to common scams (though rely more on LLM for nuance).
  - Return structured results (e.g., `{'dmarc': 'pass', 'domain_rep': 'suspicious', 'ip_rep': 'clean'}`).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, libraries like `spf`, `dkimpy`, `dmarc`, `requests` (for API calls), potentially Redis (for caching threat intel results).

**5. Gemini Contextual Analysis Module:**

- **How To:**

  - Create a dedicated microservice or library to interact with the Gemini API.
  - **API Authentication:** Use the Google AI Generative Language API key stored securely in Secret Manager.
  - **Prompt Engineering (Critical Step):**

    - Design specific prompts for Gemini to analyze the _cleaned text body_ and potentially key headers (`Subject`, `From`). Include instructions to act as a security analyst.
    - **Example Prompt Structure:**

      ```prompt
      Analyze the following email content for potential social engineering risks. Provide output in JSON format only.

      Email Subject: {subject}
      Sender: {sender_address}
      Email Body:
      ---
      {cleaned_email_body}
      ---

      Analysis Tasks:
      1.  **Intent Classification:** What is the primary intent? Choose one: [Payment Request, Credential Request, Urgent Action Required, Information Request, Gift Card Request, Job Offer Scam, Marketing, Personal Communication, Other]. Provide confidence score (0.0-1.0).
      2.  **Urgency Score:** Rate the perceived urgency on a scale of 1 (Low) to 5 (High).
      3.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Describe the overall tone (e.g., Normal, Manipulative, Threatening, Overly Friendly).
      4.  **Impersonation Signals:** Are there signs of potential impersonation (e.g., unusual sign-off, mismatched names, tone inconsistent with typical business comms)? [Yes/No/Uncertain]. Explain briefly if Yes.
      5.  **Extracted Entities:** List any sensitive entities found (e.g., bank names, amounts, login URLs, personal info requests).
      6.  **Overall Risk Assessment:** Based *only* on the text context, provide a preliminary risk level: [Low, Medium, High].
      ```

    - **Model Selection:** Choose the appropriate Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` for faster/cheaper analysis, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` for potentially higher accuracy).

  - **API Call & Response Handling:** Make the API call (`generateContent` method). Parse the JSON response from Gemini. Implement error handling (API errors, rate limits, content filtering).

- **Tech Stack:** Python, `google.generativeai` SDK, GCP Secret Manager.

**6. Risk Scoring & Decision Engine:**

- **How To:**
  - Combine the structured outputs from the Traditional Checks Module (Step 4) and the Gemini Analysis Module (Step 5).
  - Develop a scoring algorithm. Start simple:
    - Assign numerical values to outputs (e.g., DMARC fail = 10 points, Gemini High Risk = 20 points, Urgent Intent = 5 points, Suspicious Domain = 15 points).
    - Calculate a weighted sum based on the perceived importance of each signal.
    - Define thresholds for final risk classification (e.g., 0-10: Low, 11-25: Medium, 26+: High).
  - This logic can evolve into a more sophisticated ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression trained on feedback data) later.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (potentially using `scikit-learn` if building a classifier model later).

**7. Warning Generation & Email Modification:**

- **How To:**
  - If the final risk score exceeds the 'Medium' or 'High' threshold:
    - **Generate Explanation (Gemini):** Make another call to Gemini (or use a cached part of the previous analysis). Prompt it specifically to generate a concise, user-friendly warning message explaining the _key_ risks detected (e.g., "Potential impersonation and unusual payment request detected.").
    - **Inject Warning:** Use the Gmail API (`users.messages.modify`) with the Service Account credentials to:
      - **Option A (Simpler MVP):** Prepend the generated warning text (clearly marked, e.g., `"[AI SECURITY WARNING]: ..."`) to the beginning of the email body.
      - **Option B (Better UX, More Complex):** Add a specific Gmail Label (e.g., "AI-Risk-Detected"). Separately, build a simple Gmail Add-on (using Apps Script or CardService) that users install, which checks for this label and displays a warning banner/card within the Gmail UI. Prepending is easier for initial MVP.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, `google.generativeai` SDK, Gmail API (`users.messages.modify`), potentially Google Apps Script / CardService (for Option B).

**8. Logging, Monitoring & Basic Admin Interface:**

- **How To:**
  - **Logging:** Implement detailed structured logging throughout the process (using Google Cloud Logging). Log decisions, risk scores, contributing factors (anonymized where possible), errors.
  - **Monitoring:** Set up Google Cloud Monitoring dashboards for key metrics: processing latency, error rates (API calls, processing steps), Pub/Sub queue depth, function execution times. Set up alerts for critical failures.
  - **Admin Interface (Basic MVP):** Build a simple web application (e.g., using Cloud Run + Flask/Django + basic frontend like Bootstrap/React) protected by Google Identity Platform (IAP) or standard login. It should allow admins to:
    - View a list of recently processed emails flagged as Medium/High risk (showing Message-ID, sender, subject, risk score, Gemini explanation).
    - Provide simple feedback (e.g., "Accurate Flag", "False Positive"). Store this feedback in Cloud SQL to potentially improve the scoring model later.
- **Tech Stack:** Google Cloud Logging, Google Cloud Monitoring, Python (Flask/Django), React/Vue/Bootstrap, Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), Google Identity Platform (IAP).

This detailed plan provides a technical roadmap focusing on the Google ecosystem. Key success factors will be robust error handling, secure credential management, effective prompt engineering for Gemini, and iterating on the risk scoring based on real-world results and feedback.
